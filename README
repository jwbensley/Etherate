Update:

    EtheratMT is now in beta which is a multi-threaded (MT) version of
    Etherate. EtherateMT is a simple high volume traffic generator with less
    features than Etherate aimed at testing network and device load rather
    than specific traffic properties like Etherate.
    https://github.com/jwbensley/EtherateMT


What is it

    Etherate is a Linux CLI application for testing layer 2 Ethernet and MPLS
    connectivity. It can generate various Ethernet and MPLS frames for testing
    different devices such as switches/routers/firewalls etc, to test
    traffic parsing/matching/filtering/forwarding.


Why was it made

    Programs such as iPerf/jPerf/Ostinato/PathEth/Scapy/PtkGen/MoonGen (to name
    just a few) are excellent! They can saturate a link to measure throughput,
    or simulate congestion, or allow the user to set custom DSCP values to test
    QoS, etc. They usually operate at layer 3 or 4 of the OSI model using either
    TCP or UDP for data transport. Some of them use sockets defined by the OS
    that rely on a convoluted OS TCP/IP stack, others use 3rd party libraries
    (such as libpcap, NetMap etc).

    These programs are great for testing over a layer 3 boundary such as across
    the Internet, home broadband, client to server diagnostics etc. Etherate
    uses raw sockets within Linux operating directly over layer 2 to provide
    low level network analysis for Ethernet and MPLS connections without using
    any 3rd party libraries or kernel bypass techniques.

    The aim is free Ethernet and MPLS testing program that allows for advanced
    network analysis. With any modern day CPU and off the self NIC it should
    saturate up to a 10GigE link using 1500 byte frames and allow for the
    testing of various metro and carrier Ethernet features (such tag swapping,
    802.1p QoS, ethertype parsing, and so on). This should all be achievable
    without the need to install any 3rd party libraries (see INSTALL for
    details). Etherate can simply be compiled and executed from the folder it
    was downloaded to and provide "quick and dirty" tests or advanced bespoke
    testing using custom frame files.


Current version

    1.14 (2017-09)


Current features

    Having moved from alpha, to beta, and now to production version 1.x the
    focus now is to finish the remaining features of Etherate, then provide bug
    fixes only. This is to support the development of EtherateMT instead.

    Currently working features which all operate directly over layer 2:
  
  - Any EtherType
  - Any Source MAC and/or Destination MAC
  - Any VLAN ID
  - Any priority (PCP) value
  - Supports double tagging (any inner and outer VLAN ID, any PCP)
  - Toggle DEI bit
  - Toggle frame acknowledgement
  - Optional speed limit in Mbps, MBps or Frames/p/s
  - Optional frame payload size
  - Optional transfer limit in MBs/GBs
  - Optional test duration
  - L2 storm (BUM) testing
  - One way delay measurement (at layer 2!)
  - Perform sweeping MTU test
  - Perform link quality tests (RTT & jitter, at layer 2!)
  - Simulate MPLS label stacks
  - Insert MPLS pseudowire control word
  - Load a custom frame from file for transmission
  - Some examples are provided to simulate BPDUs, ARP, ICMP, TCP


Development plan

    Etherate is developed primarily for use on Ubuntu and CentOS as these are
    the authors day to day platforms. If it doesn't work on your bedroom Linux
    based OS, it's unlikely I'll have time help you. If it doesn't work on some
    other major Linux based OS I'll try and find the time to spin up a VM and
    replicate your issues. Ubuntu and CentOS are the main focus though.
    
    The features currently being worked upon can be seen in the issues section:
    https://github.com/jwbensley/Etherate/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement
  
    The Etherate code is partially object orientated, single threaded and only 
    uni-directionl so once the above feature list is completed development will
    cease (except for bug fixes), a new multi-threaded version is currently
    being developed: https://github.com/jwbensley/EtherateMT

    There is a Code of Conduct for contributing to the project in any way:

    Ultimately, just be friendly and I'll do my best to accept patches and
    accept bug fixes etc.


Technical details

    Etherate is a single threaded application, despite which 10G throughput
    can be achieved on a 2.4Ghz Intel CPU with 10G Intel NIC using 1500 byte
    frames. Etherate is not currently using NetMap, DPDK, VPP or other similar
    frameworks as it is intended to test the OS's native capabilities and be
    easily usable without any 3rd party requirements (apart from a recent
    Kernel!). If you want 64 byte packet line rate performance on Nx10G or
    Nx100G etc then Etherate is not for you. There are some great projects such
    as MoonGen and PtkGen which Etherate cannot compete with for performance.
    DPDK and PktGen or MoonGen require additional setup time and complexity
    which is the trade-off with Etherate. Etherate can load a custom frame from
    a file to transmit and test a traffic parsing graph or fill a specific ASIC
    queue with minimal effort.
